# 🚀 CODESIGNAL - COMPREHENSIVE INTRODUCTION TO FRONT-END ENGINEERING

Hi! 👋

Last **April 2025** I got challenged to do **every web development course** we could find! A challenge I happily accepted. 🎉  
This repository contains all my projects, challenges, and extra exercises from [Codesignal - Comprehensive Introduction to Front-End Engineering](https://codesignal.com/learn/paths/comprehensive-introduction-to-front-end-engineering).

## 🎓 Curriculum Overview

**CodeSignal's Comprehensive Introduction to Front-End Engineering** consists of 6 courses, each course contains excersizes, real-life projects and assessments.  
Below you'll find the platform projects and challenge projects I’ve completed or am (currently) working on. So far, this course is also a lot of fun! 
(Ok, honestly, below you won't find the projects just yet, but you will very soon - I pinky promise 😊)
