# 🚀 CODESIGNAL - COMPREHENSIVE INTRODUCTION TO FRONT-END ENGINEERING

Hi! 👋

Last **April 2025** I got challenged to do **every web development course** we could find! A challenge I happily accepted. 🎉  
This repository contains all my projects, challenges, and extra exercises from [Codesignal - Comprehensive Introduction to Front-End Engineering](https://codesignal.com/learn/paths/comprehensive-introduction-to-front-end-engineering).
